We will only interview candidates with hands-on experience developing as a part of a B2B SaaS company’s engineering team. Please be sure to offer evidence in your application to demonstrate how you meet this requirement.

Left Hook seeks a Senior Full Stack Developer to partner with our remote development team to deliver integration experiences that are consistently high-quality, on time, and on budget.

ABOUT LEFT HOOK:
Left Hook builds and manages self-serve, productized integration experiences for best-in-class B2B software companies like Canva, Docusign, FreshBooks, Crossbeam, and dozens more. Our hands-on experience with over 200 different SaaS APIs, our MERN stack development skills, and our marketer’s understanding of tech partnerships provide us an expertise highly valued by our SaaS clients. See: https://lefthook.com

Left Hook is also the creator and lead developer of a new open source project, the Frigg Integration Framework. See: https://friggframework.org

At the moment Left Hook is a professional services firm. We sell hours to clients, who pay us to build integration experiences powered by the Frigg Framework. These MERN mini-apps are embedded and white labeled inside our client’s product UI, for use by their non-technical end-customers.

In 2024 we expect to transition into a product company with our own proprietary SaaS offering(s). This transition is not guaranteed. Selling consulting/contracting hours will remain the primary way we make money for the foreseeable future.

Before you apply,* please self-evaluate your willingness to attempt this challenging transition*.

We will interview candidates who indicate this understanding/willingness in their application.

ROLE OVERVIEW:
You will work closely with our full stack development team to build self-serve integration experiences to spec, on time and on budget.

You will also contribute to our Frigg Integration Framework and to our upcoming Integration Opportunity (IO) Platform, a proprietary SaaS product.

Strong candidates will have 5+ years hands-in-the-code experience building B2B SaaS applications.

Significant experience integrating third-party SaaS APIs is highly desirable, as is experience with AWS Lamba or other serverless infrastructure providers.

This is an "individual contributor" role that can happen both remote and with flexibility. However, we expect our developers to overlap at least six hours a day with our standard EST work hours (typically 9am to 6pm EST.)
