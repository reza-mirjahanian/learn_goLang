We are using [`sync.WaitGroup`](https://golang.org/pkg/sync/#WaitGroup) which is a convenient way of synchronising concurrent processes.

> A WaitGroup waits for a collection of goroutines to finish. The main goroutine calls Add to set the number of goroutines to wait for. Then each of the goroutines runs and calls Done when finished. At the same time, Wait can be used to block until all goroutines have finished.

-   `Mutex` allows us to add locks to our data
    

-   `WaitGroup` is a means of waiting for goroutines to finish jobs

To create an engaging and informative educational content on Mutexes in Go, we can structure it into several sections, each focusing on a different aspect of mutexes, their use cases, and how to implement them effectively. Here's a suggested outline:

### Introduction to Mutexes in Go
- **What is a Mutex?**: Explain the concept of mutual exclusion, or a mutex, in the context of concurrent programming. Mention that mutexes are used to prevent data races by ensuring that only one goroutine can access shared data at a time [0][1].
- **Why Use Mutexes?**: Discuss the importance of mutexes in concurrent programming, especially in Go, where goroutines are used for concurrent execution. Highlight the problem of data races and how mutexes solve it by providing a mechanism to synchronize access to shared data [0][1].

### How Mutexes Work in Go
- **Working Mechanism**: Describe the basic mechanism of a mutex in Go, including acquiring a lock before accessing shared data and releasing the lock after the operation is complete. This section can include a simple example to illustrate the concept [0].
- **Lock and Unlock**: Explain the `Lock` and `Unlock` methods of the `sync.Mutex` type, showing how they are used to control access to shared data. Include code snippets to demonstrate lock acquisition and release [1].

### Practical Example: Implementing a Mutex in Go
- **Example Code**: Provide a practical example of using a mutex to prevent data races in a Go program. This example can include a scenario where multiple goroutines are incrementing a shared counter. Use the `sync.Mutex` to ensure that the counter is updated correctly without race conditions [0][1].
- **Code Walkthrough**: Break down the example code, explaining each part of the mutex usage, including where and how the lock is acquired and released. Highlight the importance of `defer` for unlocking to ensure that the lock is always released, even if an error occurs [1].

### Advanced Topics
- **Defer and Mutex**: Discuss the use of `defer` with mutexes for ensuring that the lock is always released, making the code safer and more readable. Explain the benefits of using `defer` for unlocking [4].
- **Reader/Writer Mutex**: Introduce the `sync.RWMutex` type, which allows for more granular control over access to data, allowing multiple readers but only one writer at a time. Explain when and how to use `RLock` and `RUnlock` for read operations [4].
- **Mutex in Structs**: Show how to include a mutex within a struct to protect its fields. This approach makes it easier to manage concurrent access to the struct's data, providing a clear encapsulation of the mutex and its protected data [4].
