In Go, the `reflect.DeepEqual` function is used to determine if two values are deeply equal to each other. It does a deep comparison, checking nested and unexported fields as well, which is not possible with the simple `==` operator.

Here's a basic example of how to use `reflect.DeepEqual`:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"reflect"
)

type Person struct {
	Name string
	Age  int
}

func main() {
	p1 := Person{"John", 30}
	p2 := Person{"John", 30}

	fmt.Println(reflect.DeepEqual(p1, p2)) // Output: true

	p3 := Person{"John", 31}

	fmt.Println(reflect.DeepEqual(p1, p3)) // Output: false
}
```

In this example, we have a `Person` struct with `Name` and `Age` fields. We create two identical `Person` instances (`p1` and `p2`) and one different (`p3`). When we compare `p1` and `p2` using `reflect.DeepEqual`, it returns `true` because all their fields are equal. But when we compare `p1` and `p3`, it returns `false` because their `Age` fields are different.

Please note that `reflect.DeepEqual` can be slower than the `==` operator, so it's recommended to use it only when necessary.

Mocking in Go is a technique used in unit testing to replace real dependencies with fake ones, allowing you to isolate the code under test and control the behavior of its dependencies.

One common way to create mocks in Go is by using interfaces. You can define an interface that your code under test depends on, then create a mock that implements this interface for testing.

Here's a simple example:

First, let's define an interface for a service that our function depends on:

```go
package main

type EmailSender interface {
    Send(to string, body string) error
}
```

Next, let's create a function that uses this service:

```go
func WelcomeNewUser(userEmail string, sender EmailSender) error {
    // some logic here...
    return sender.Send(userEmail, "Welcome to our platform!")
}
```

Now, we can create a mock for the `EmailSender` interface:

```go
type EmailSenderMock struct {
    SendFunc func(to string, body string) error
}

func (m *EmailSenderMock) Send(to string, body string) error {
    return m.SendFunc(to, body)
}
```

In our tests, we can control the behavior of the `Send` method:

```go
func TestWelcomeNewUser(t *testing.T) {
    senderMock := &EmailSenderMock{
        SendFunc: func(to string, body string) error {
            if to == "" {
                t.Error("Expected to to be set")
            }
            if body == "" {
                t.Error("Expected body to be set")
            }
            return nil
        },
    }

    err := WelcomeNewUser("test@example.com", senderMock)
    if err != nil {
        t.Errorf("Expected no error, got %v", err)
    }
}
```

In this test, we're verifying that `WelcomeNewUser` calls the `Send` method with the correct parameters. If it doesn't, the test will fail.

This is a simple example, but you can make your mocks as complex as you need to simulate the behavior of your dependencies accurately.
