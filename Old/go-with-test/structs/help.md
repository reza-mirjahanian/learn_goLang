In Go (Golang), an interface is a collection of method signatures that a type can implement. It's a way to define behavior that can be reused across different types.

Here's a basic example of an interface in Go:

```go
type Shape interface {
    Area() float64
    Perimeter() float64
}
```

In this example, `Shape` is an interface that defines two methods: `Area()` and `Perimeter()`. Any type that implements these methods is said to satisfy the `Shape` interface.

Here's how you might implement this interface for a `Rectangle` type:

```go
type Rectangle struct {
    Width  float64
    Height float64
}

func (r Rectangle) Area() float64 {
    return r.Width * r.Height
}

func (r Rectangle) Perimeter() float64 {
    return 2 * (r.Width + r.Height)
}
```

In this example, the `Rectangle` type has two fields: `Width` and `Height`. It also has two methods: `Area()` and `Perimeter()`, which satisfy the `Shape` interface.

You can use the `Shape` interface to work with any type that satisfies it. For example:

```go
func PrintShapeDetails(s Shape) {
    fmt.Println("Area:", s.Area())
    fmt.Println("Perimeter:", s.Perimeter())
}

func main() {
    r := Rectangle{Width: 5, Height: 10}
    PrintShapeDetails(r)
}
```

In this example, `PrintShapeDetails()` can accept any type that satisfies the `Shape` interface, and it will work correctly regardless of the specific type.

Interfaces in Go are a powerful tool for designing flexible and extensible code. They allow you to define behavior that can be implemented by any type, and they can be used to write more generic and reusable code.
