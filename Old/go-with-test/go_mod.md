Here is an explanation of the basic structure and contents of a go.mod file in Go:

```
module example.com/myproject

go 1.17

require (
    github.com/gorilla/mux v1.8.0
    golang.org/x/text v0.3.7
    rsc.io/quote v1.5.2
)

```

The key components are:

-   `module`: Defines the module path for this project that will be used when importing packages within the project. This follows a domain/path format.

-   `go`: Specifies the required Go language version for the project. This should be the lowest version that contains the features being used.

-   `require`: Lists the dependencies required for the project along with a version constraint. Each dependency line lists an import path along with a semantic version constraint.


So in summary:

-   `module`  defines the base import path
-   `go`  sets the language version
-   `require`  lists the external dependencies

This provides enough information for Go tools to locate, download, and use the correct dependency versions for builds and tests. Additional metadata like commenting dependencies or noting replacements for inactive projects is also allowed.Here is an explanation of the basic structure and contents of a go.mod file in Go:
